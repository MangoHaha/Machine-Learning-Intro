Why CNN become so popular?

Bascially any data that has spatial relationships is ripe for applying CNN. For instance, image, video and even text.
 We saw how using deep neural networks on very large images increases the computation and memory cost. 
 To combat this obstacle, we will see how convolutions and convolutional neural networks help us to 
 bring down these factors and generate better results.


There are a number of hyperparameters that we can tweak while building a convolutional network. 
These include the number of filters, size of filters, stride to be used, padding.

In a convolutional network (ConvNet), there are basically three types of layers:

Convolution layer
Pooling layer
Fully connected layer

There are a combination of convolution and pooling layers at the beginning, a few fully connected layers at the end 
and finally a softmax classifier to classify the input into various categories.

Cross entropy indicates the distance between what the model believes the output distribution should be, and what the original distribution really is.
