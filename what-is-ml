supervised vs unsupervised model
what is supervised model?
Given (x1, y1) ... (xn,yn), xi are date points, yi are target values. 
So ML task is to choose a function f(x) = y, and the function must be generalized.
As the result, given f(x'), you can get y'
There are not perfect models, we have to do this based on assumptions.

Supervised model normally including:
regression: yi belongs to finite set  (y1, ... yn)
classification : yi can be in any real values R

Unsupervised model: it is finding the patterns for the data
Clustering
Density estimation
Dimensionality reduction
