supervised vs unsupervised model
what is supervised model?
Given (x1, y1) ... (xn,yn), xi are date points, yi are target values. 
So ML task is to choose a function f(x) = y, and the function must be generalized.
As the result, given f(x'), you can get y'
There are not perfect models, we have to do this based on assumptions.

Supervised model normally including:
regression: yi belongs to finite set  (y1, ... yn)
classification : yi can be in any real values R

Unsupervised model: it is finding the patterns for the data
Clustering
Density estimation
Dimensionality reduction

We also need to know the distinguish between:
A Discriminative model ‌models the decision boundary between the classes. 
A Generative Model explicitly models the actual distribution of each class.
A Generative Model ‌learns the joint probability distribution p(x,y). It predicts the conditional probability with the help of Bayes Theorem. 
A Discriminative model ‌learns the conditional probability distribution p(y|x). 
Both of these models were generally used in supervised learning problems.
